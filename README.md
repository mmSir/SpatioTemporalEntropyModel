# GainedVAE

A Pytorch Implementation of a continuously rate adjustable learned image compression framework, Gained Variational Autoencoder(GainedVAE).

*Note that It Is Not An Official Implementation Code.*

# Environment

* Python == 3.7.10
* Pytorch == 1.7.1
* CompressAI

# Dataset
I use a part of the OpenImages Dataset to train the models (train06, train07, train08, about 54w images). You can download from here[Download OpenImages](https://www.appen.com.cn/datasets/open-images-annotated-with-bounding-boxes/).
Maybe train08 (14w images) is enough.


# Train Your Own Model
>python3 trainGain.py -d /path/to/your/image/dataset/ --epochs 200 -lr 1e-4 --batch-size 16 --model-save /path/to/your/model/save/dir --cuda
# Result

# Acknowledgement

The framework is based on CompressAI, I add the model in compressai.models.gain, compressai.models.gain_utils.  
And trainGain/trainGain.py is modified with reference to compressai_examples/train.py.
